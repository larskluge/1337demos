* What version of jQuery I should use?

jQuery 1.4, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 can be used. However because of http://jsbin.com/uboxu3/7/ issue it is
recommended to use jQuery 1.4.1 .

* Install testing requirements?

> gem install bundler
> bundle install

* How do I run tests?

> bundle exec ruby test/server.rb

Visit http://localhost:4567 and all the tests should pass. If you want to change any settings  then
change the settings at the top of test/public/test/settings.js .
